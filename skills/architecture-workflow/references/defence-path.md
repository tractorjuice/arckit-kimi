# Defence Project Path

## When This Path Applies

- Ministry of Defence (MOD) projects
- Defence contractors working on MOD programmes
- Projects subject to JSP 440 (Defence Manual of Security)
- IAMM (Information Assurance Maturity Model) applies
- Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS) procurement likely
- Security clearance requirements for team

## Compliance Frameworks

- JSP 440 (Defence Manual of Security)
- IAMM (Information Assurance Maturity Model)
- MOD Secure by Design
- Technology Code of Practice (TCoP)
- JSP 936 (MOD AI Assurance) — if AI/ML components
- Green Book / Orange Book (HM Treasury)

## AI/ML Additions

> See ai-ml-path.md for full AI/ML additions; the entries below are defence-specific supplements only.

If the defence project includes AI/ML components, add these commands:

| # | Command | Where to Insert | Rationale | Artifacts |
|---|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| — | `/skill:arckit-mlops` | Phase 7, after devops | ML model lifecycle, training pipelines | ARC-{PID}-MLOP-v1.0.md |
| — | `/skill:arckit-jsp-936` | Phase 8, after mod-secure | MOD AI Assurance (JSP 936) | ARC-{PID}-JSP936-v1.0.md |

### Critical Gates for AI Projects

- JSP 936 risk classification determines approval pathway:
  - **Critical**: 2PUS/Ministerial approval
  - **Severe/Major**: Defence-Level JROC/IAC approval
  - **Moderate/Minor**: TLB-Level approval

## Optional Commands

| Command | When to Add | Phase |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `/skill:arckit-strategy` | Executive strategy synthesis needed | After Phase 3 |
| `/skill:arckit-platform-design` | Defence platform or shared service | Phase 3 |
| `/skill:arckit-data-mesh-contract` | Federated data products across TLBs | Phase 3 |
| `/skill:arckit-gcloud-search` | G-Cloud procurement (alternative to DOS) | Phase 4 |
| `/skill:arckit-finops` | Cloud cost management | Phase 7 |
| `/skill:arckit-servicenow` | ServiceNow CMDB integration | Phase 7 |
| `/skill:arckit-presentation` | Governance board slide deck | Phase 9 |

## Minimum Viable Path

For initial security assessment preparation:

1. `/skill:arckit-principles`
2. `/skill:arckit-stakeholders`
3. `/skill:arckit-requirements`
4. `/skill:arckit-risk`
5. `/skill:arckit-mod-secure`

## Duration

- **Non-AI projects**: 12-24 months
- **AI projects**: 18-36 months
- **Minimum viable**: 3-6 weeks

## Critical Gates

- MOD Secure by Design (JSP 440, IAMM) required before Beta
- Security clearances required for all team members
- JSP 936 AI assurance required before Beta (AI projects only)
